# [KendoStrapAng3 (KSA3) = Kendo UI + Bootstrap 3 + AngularJS](http://html5boilerplate.com)


KSA3 is a boilerplate project for the intergration of Kendo UI, Twitter Bootstrap 3 and AngularJS. It was born of
my own necessity to create an application using these 3 awesome frameworks. I figured before I started coding it for my particular needs
I'd opensource the product so that anyone else needing a similar stack can have a starting point.


Hope this helps you all out, enjoy!
